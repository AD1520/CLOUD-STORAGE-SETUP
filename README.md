# DESCRIPTION
I have successfully created and configured cloud storage using Amazon S3 as part of my internship at CodTech. I created a new S3 bucket named "awsnewbucket1123" and uploaded sample files to demonstrate proper cloud storage setup. The bucket includes a folder called "Unknown/", which contains example content. I configured access permissions to ensure secure file access and management. The setup also consists of the ability to create additional folders, upload new files, generate S3 URIs and URLs, and manage access using the provided options within the AWS Management Console. This task fulfils the internship requirement of delivering a fully configured cloud storage bucket with uploaded content and access control. I look forward to receiving the completion certificate on my internship end date.
